      <br></br><br></br>
      These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern how you may access and use the Site and Services and your responsibilities when doing so. NAR’s Privacy Policy explains how NAR may use any personal information shared by you. By accessing <a href="">www.smarthomechecklist.com</a> or using the Services, you agree to these Terms and NAR’s Privacy Policy, so please take a moment to carefully review these documents.

      <b>Modifications</b>
      <br></br><br></br>

      <br></br><br></br>
      The Services allow you to create a list of smart home devices associated with a particular property, including links to the respective manufacturers’ websites. The Services do not permit you to “link” to any personal accounts that may exist for current operating smart home devices. Any created list may be saved to your local device, and you may share the created list using your local device. The Services do not directly e-mail any content for you. NAR provides the Site and Services free of charge. Your right to access and use the Site and Services is personal to you and may not be transferred to any third party.
      <br></br><br></br>
      NAR may suspend the Services or stop providing the Services to you at any time and for any reason, including your violation of these Terms. Your access of the Site and use of the Services may be interrupted from time to time for reasons including, but not limited to, updating of, maintenance to, or repair of the Site or Services. NAR will not be liable to any party for any loss, cost, or damage that results from any interruptions in service or downtime, scheduled or unscheduled, for any duration of time.
      <br></br><br></br>
      The Site and Services are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal or professional advice. The Services do not create any type of legally binding document. Please consult with the appropriate professional if you have any questions relating to smart home devices or the transfer of control of smart home devices during a real estate transaction.
