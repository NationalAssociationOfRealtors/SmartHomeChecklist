      <p><b>PRIVACY POLICY FOR <a href="">WWW.SMARTHOMECHECKLIST.COM</a></b>
      <br></br><br></br>
      Thanks for visiting www.smarthomechecklist.com. The National Association of REALTORS® (“NAR”) takes its obligation to safeguard and secure your personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines NAR’s privacy practices and describes how NAR treats any personal information collected while you use www.smarthomechecklist.com (the “Site”) and NAR’s services (“Services”) available through the Site. You consent to the collection of your personal information, as outlined herein, by accessing and using the Site and Services.
      <br></br><br></br>
      Please note that this Policy does not pertain to any third-party websites available through the Site. NAR encourages you to carefully review the privacy policies at any third-party websites accessed through the Site.
      <br></br><br></br>
      <b>Types of Personal Information that NAR Collects</b>
      <br></br><br></br>
      NAR does not collect or store personal information from any users of the Site or Services. Registration is not required to access or use the Site or Services. The Services allow you to create a list of smart home devices associated with a particular property, including links to the respective manufacturers’ websites. The Services do not permit you to “link” to any personal accounts that may exist for current operating smart home devices. All lists created using the Services are stored locally on the device used to access the Services. A user must use his or her local device to share any created list.
      <br></br><br></br>
      NAR collects tracking information when you are using or accessing the Site and Services. Tracking information is information that our server automatically recognizes each time you visit the Site, use the Services or communicate with us by email (for example, your domain name, your IP address, browser information, location information, your email address, and what pages you visit). Tracking information is aggregate and does not identify you. NAR shares tracking information with third party companies used to analyze aggregate tracking data, such as Google Analytics. NAR does not share tracking information with any other third parties.
      <br></br><br></br>
      NAR also collects any information you volunteer by contacting NAR about the Site or Services, including, for example, your email address and name. NAR will not share personal information received in this manner with any third party unless we have given you prior notice that the information will be shared or we receive your permission to do so.
      <br></br><br></br>
      <b>How NAR Uses Personal Information</b>
      <br></br><br></br>
      NAR uses collected information described above to track usage of the Site and Services, analyze the performance of the Site and Services, and improve and customize the Site and Services.
      <br></br><br></br>
      <b>Cookies and Web Tags</b>
      <br></br><br></br>
      A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a website that is saved by your web browser when you access a website. It holds information a website may need to interact with you and personalize your experience. NAR uses cookies to gather the information identified in “Types of Personal Information that NAR Collects.” Cookies help NAR learn how visitors use the Site, which in turn helps NAR create a better Site. If for some reason you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies to accept (depending on the sophistication of your web browser). If you reject the cookie, you may still effectively use the Site and Services; however, you will not be able to locally store any created lists.
      <br></br><br></br>
      <b>Security</b>
      <br></br><br></br>
      NAR follows generally accepted standards to protect the information it collects through your access and use of the Site and Services. NAR tests its security procedures regularly and modifies them as new technologies become feasible.
      <br></br><br></br>
      <b>Email Communications</b>

      NAR does not collect e-mail addresses or require registration for use of the Site or Services. You may choose to contact NAR from your email address using the contact information that is available on the Site and the Terms of Use. If you choose to email NAR, you consent to representatives of NAR responding to your email and sending to you follow-up communications directly related to your email.
